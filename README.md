# Fix
A small recursion-free total programming language.

This is just a lark. A language where you have to use fixed-points of functors to do pretty much anything. PRs welcome.

## the plan

* generalize `Mu` and `Nu` over {co}monads
* target [Morte](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Morte-Library)
